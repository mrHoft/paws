## Fast Paws
A cute cat on an endless adventure! Time your jumps to catch prey and avoid obstacles. Hold to charge your leap—the longer you hold, the bigger the jump! Unlock new locations, catch animals and build combos in this charming and challenging arcade game.

### Description
Step into the paws of a clever cat in this endless arcade-platformer! Your goal is simple: catch prey and avoid obstacles by mastering the charge-jump mechanic. Press and hold to aim your leap—precision is key! Succeed, and you'll earn points and build a combo multiplier. Fail, and you'll be sent back with a score penalty.

The world is alive with challenge: butterflies flutter, mice dodge, and birds can fly away. You'll also face pesky obstacles like garden gnomes, puddles, and chasing dogs. Explore different locations—a sunny backyard, a dusty basement, a high rooftop—each with unique critters and platforms. As your score grows, so does the difficulty. Watch your cat react to the world with delightful animations, from shaking a wet paw to stealthily stalking its prey. Compete on global leaderboards and enjoy the changing seasons in this endlessly engaging feline adventure!

### How to Play
- Control: Press and hold the SPACEBAR, MOUSE button, or TAP to make the cat jump. The longer you hold, the higher and further the leap.
